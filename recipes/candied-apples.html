        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> cooking spray </li>
            <li> 15 craft sticks </li>
            <li> 15 medium apples </li>
            <li> 2 cups white sugar </li>

                Heat to 300 to 310 degrees F (149 to 154 degrees C), 
                or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms hard, brittle threads.
